# LeapCode ML Course

A complete, beginner-to-intermediate machine learning course built entirely in Jupyter notebooks.
This course focuses on understanding how models think.

--- 
## Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- Conceptual clarity over library dependency

- Visual intuition through plots & experiments

- Data-driven thinking from raw CSV → deployable model

- Real mistakes: overfitting, noisy data, bias, and broken assumptions

## Course Overview

The end of each unit contains a progress check to evaluate understanding

### Unit 1 – Introduction to Machine Learning

Goal: Build intuition for what ML actually is and when it fails.

| Topics                                  |
| --------------------------------------- |
| What is ML vs rule-based programming    |
| Supervised vs Unsupervised learning     |
| Features, labels, training vs inference |
| Real-world examples & failure cases     |
| Prediction error & evaluation mindset   |

### Unit 2 – Learning From Data

Goal: Explore specific models and train them on real world data

| Topics                                  |
| --------------------------------------- |
| Linear Regression                       |
| Logistic Regression                     |
| Metrics for Regression                  |
| Metrics for Classification              |

### Unit 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Goal: Learn how to preprocess datasets to make them ready for machine learning. Additionally, understand how to utilize Pandas and Seaborn to visualize data.

| Topics                        |
| ----------------------------- |
| Pandas Overview               |
| Seaborn Overview              |
| Dealing with Missing Values   |
| Outlier detection             |
| Feature engineering           |
| Handling Categorical Variables|

### Unit 4 – Smarter Models: Trees & Forests

Goal: Master modern ML

| Topics                             |
| ---------------------------------- |
| Decision Trees intuition           |
| How Random Forests reduce variance |
| Overfitting & Underfitting         |
